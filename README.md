Glint is a Chrome extention that works on Github pages that list JavaScript files. It adds a "Lint this File" button to the page. When clicked, it will run JSLint on the JavaScript code. It will then highlight the lines of code for which JSLint reported errors. Hovering over the red line numbers will show up the error messages.
